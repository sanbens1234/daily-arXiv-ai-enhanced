However, existing methods often rely on direct fine-tuning of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), feeding semantic and visual features directly into a policy network without fully addressing the unique semantic alignment challenges in the VLA domain. In this paper, we propose HMVLA, a novel VLA framework that exploits the inherent hierarchical structures in vision and language for comprehensive semantic alignment. Unlike traditional methods that perform alignment in Euclidean space, our HMVLA embeds multimodal features in hyperbolic space, enabling more effective modeling of the hierarchical relationships present in image text data. Furthermore, we introduce a sparsely gated Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism tailored for semantic alignment, which enhances multimodal comprehension between images and text while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HMVLA surpasses baseline methods in both accuracy and generalization. In addition, we validate its robustness by reconstructing datasets to further test cross domain adaptability."}

Recent generative models promise end-to-end synthesis, but their reliance on unstructured noise priors often yields unsafe, inefficient, or unimodal plans that cannot meet real-time requirements. We propose StepNav, a novel framework that bridges this gap by introducing structured, multimodal trajectory priors derived from variational principles. StepNav first learns a geometry-aware success probability field to identify all feasible navigation corridors. These corridors are then used to construct an explicit, multi-modal mixture prior that initializes a conditional flow-matching process. This refinement is formulated as an optimal control problem with explicit smoothness and safety regularization. By replacing unstructured noise with physically-grounded candidates, StepNav generates safer and more efficient plans in significantly fewer steps. Experiments in both simulation and real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in robustness, efficiency, and safety over state-of-the-art generative planners, advancing reliable trajectory generation for practical autonomous navigation.

Some of these approaches also fail to recover occluded joints that are only revealed during interaction. Others require large numbers of multi-view images for every object, which is impractical in real-world settings. Furthermore, prior works neglect the order of manipulations, which is essential for many multi-DoF objects where one joint must be operated before another, such as a dishwasher. We introduce PokeNet, an end-to-end framework that estimates articulation models from a single human demonstration without prior object knowledge. Given a sequence of point cloud observations of a human manipulating an unknown object, PokeNet predicts joint parameters, infers manipulation order, and tracks joint states over time. PokeNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, improving joint axis and state estimation accuracy by an average of over 27% across diverse objects, including novel and unseen categories. We demonstrate these gains in both simulation and real-world environments."}

Large vision and language models (VLMs) are capable of processing high-dimensional input data for visual scene and language understanding, as well as decomposing tasks into a sequence of logical steps; however, they struggle to ground those steps in embodied robot motion. On the other hand, robotics foundation models output action commands, but require in-domain fine-tuning or experience before they are able to perform novel tasks successfully. At its core, there still remains the fundamental challenge of connecting abstract task reasoning with low-level motion control. To address this disconnect, we propose Language Movement Primitives (LMPs), a framework that grounds VLM reasoning in Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) parameterization. Our key insight is that DMPs provide a small number of interpretable parameters, and VLMs can set these parameters to specify diverse, continuous, and stable trajectories. Put another way: VLMs can reason over free-form natural language task descriptions, and semantically ground their desired motions into DMPs -- bridging the gap between high-level task reasoning and low-level position and velocity control. Building on this combination of VLMs and DMPs, we formulate our LMP pipeline for zero-shot robot manipulation that effectively completes tabletop manipulation problems by generating a sequence of DMP motions. Across 20 real-world manipulation tasks, we show that LMP achieves 80% task success as compared to 31% for the best-performing baseline. See videos at our website: https://collab.me.vt.edu/lmp"}

We introduce Kino-PAX$^{+}$, a massively parallel kinodynamic SBMP with asymptotic near-optimal guarantees. Kino-PAX$^{+}$ builds a sparse tree of dynamically feasible trajectories by decomposing traditionally serial operations into three massively parallel subroutines. The algorithm focuses computation on the most promising nodes within local neighborhoods for propagation and refinement, enabling rapid improvement of solution cost. We prove that, while maintaining probabilistic $δ$-robust completeness, this focus on promising nodes ensures asymptotic $δ$-robust near-optimality.

We address both by learning structured mental-models and an estimator of others' mental-states. Building on the Influence-Based Abstraction, we instantiate an Influence-Augmented Local Model to decompose socially-aware robot tasks into local dynamics, social influences, and exogenous factors. We propose (a) a neuro-symbolic world model instantiating a factored, discrete Dynamic Bayesian Network, and (b) a perspective-shift operator modeled as an amortized Schrödinger Bridge over the learned local dynamics that transports factored egocentric beliefs into other-centric beliefs. We show that this architecture enables agents to synthesize socially-aware policies in model-based reinforcement learning, via decision-time mental-state planning (a Schrödinger Bridge in belief space), with preliminary results in a MiniGrid social navigation task."}

This paper implements Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address these challenges in a 2D indoor environment, using high-fidelity game-engine simulations (Godot) and continuous action spaces. Policy training aims to achieve emergent collaborative behaviours and decision-making under uncertainty using Network-Distributed Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ND-POMDPs). Each UAV is equipped with a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor and can share data (sensor measurements and a local occupancy map) with neighbouring agents. Inter-agent communication constraints include limited range, bandwidth and latency. Extensive ablation studies evaluated MARL training paradigms, reward function, communication system, neural network (NN) architecture, memory mechanisms, and POMDP formulations. This work jointly addresses several key limitations in prior research, namely reliance on discrete actions, single-agent or centralized formulations, assumptions of a priori knowledge and permanent connectivity, inability to handle dynamic obstacles, short planning horizons and architectural complexity in Recurrent NNs/Transformers. Results show that the scalable training paradigm, combined with a simplified architecture, enables rapid autonomous exploration of an indoor area. The implementation of Curriculum-Learning (five increasingly complex levels) also enabled faster, more robust training. This combination of high-fidelity simulation, MARL formulation, and computational efficiency establishes a strong foundation for deploying learned cooperative strategies in physical robotic systems."}

DEFT generalizes across failure types, supports constrained and unconstrained motions, and enables task completion under arbitrary failure. We evaluated DEFT in both simulation and real-world scenarios using a 7-DoF robotic arm. In simulation over thousands of joint-failure cases across multiple tasks, DEFT outperformed the baseline by up to 2 times. On failures unseen during training, it continued to outperform the baseline, indicating robust generalization in simulation.

The system consists of truss-like robotic triangles formed by continuous inflated fabric tubes routed through two robotic roller units and a connecting unit. A newly developed spherical joint enables up to three triangles to connect at a vertex, allowing construction of truss assemblies beyond a single octahedron. When deflated, the triangles compact to approximately the volume of the roller units, achieving a stowed-to-deployed volume ratio of 1:18.3. Upon inflation, the roller units pinch the tubes, locally reducing bending stiffness to form effective joints. Electric motors then translate the roller units along the tube, shifting the pinch point by lengthening one edge while shortening another at the same rate, thereby preserving a constant perimeter (isoperimetric). This shape-changing process requires no additional compressed air, enabling untethered operation after initial inflation. We demonstrate the system as a 12-degree-of-freedom solar array capable of tilting up to 60 degrees and sweeping 360 degrees, and as a 14-degree-of-freedom locomotion device using a step-and-slide gait. This modular, shape-adaptive system addresses key challenges for sustainable lunar operations and future space missions."}

Variations in dynamics, degrees of freedom (DoFs), and kinematic topology still hinder a single policy from commanding diverse humanoids. Moreover, obtaining a generalist policy that not only transfers across embodiments but also supports richer behaviors-beyond simple walking to squatting, leaning-remains especially challenging. In this work, we tackle these obstacles by introducing EAGLE, an iterative generalist-specialist distillation framework that produces a single unified policy that controls multiple heterogeneous humanoids without per-robot reward tuning. During each cycle, embodiment-specific specialists are forked from the current generalist, refined on their respective robots, and new skills are distilled back into the generalist by training on the pooled embodiment set. Repeating this loop until performance convergence produces a robust Whole-Body Controller validated on robots such as Unitree H1, G1, and Fourier N1. We conducted experiments on five different robots in simulation and four in real-world settings. Through quantitative evaluations, EAGLE achieves high tracking accuracy and robustness compared to other methods, marking a step toward scalable, fleet-level humanoid control.

RPL first trains terrain-specific expert policies with privileged height map observations to master decoupled locomotion and manipulation skills across different terrains, and then distills them into a transformer policy that leverages multiple depth cameras to cover a wide range of views. During distillation, we introduce two techniques to robustify multi-directional locomotion, depth feature scaling based on velocity commands and random side masking, which are critical for asymmetric depth observations and unseen widths of terrains. For scalable depth distillation, we develop an efficient multi-depth system that ray-casts against both dynamic robot meshes and static terrain meshes in massively parallel environments, achieving a 5-times speedup over the depth rendering pipelines in existing simulators while modeling realistic sensor latency, noise, and dropout. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate robust multi-directional locomotion with payloads (2kg) across challenging terrains, including 20° slopes, staircases with different step lengths (22 cm, 25 cm, 30 cm), and 25 cm by 25 cm stepping stones separated by 60 cm gaps."}

In this project, we designed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize both navigation and locomotion. In the first stage, the quadrupeds, Unitree Go2, were trained to climb stairs in Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain. In the second stage, the quadrupeds were trained to climb various realistic indoor staircases in the Isaac Lab engine, with the learned policy transferred from the previous stage. These indoor staircases are straight, L-shaped, and spiral, to support climbing tasks in complex environments. This project explores how to balance navigation and locomotion and how end-to-end RL methods can enable quadrupeds to adapt to different stair shapes.

To provide accurate surgical manipulation, optimization-based kinematics model was established, realizing a 2mm accuracy in positioning the tip tool (60mm length) under open-loop control strategy. As such, with the endoscopic camera, traditional PTE is possible to be upgraded as endoscopic PTE.

Attackers can pretrain VLAs on poisoned data to implant backdoors that remain stealthy but can trigger harmful behavior during inference. However, existing defenses either lack mechanistic insight into multimodal backdoors or impose prohibitive computational costs via full-model retraining. To this end, we uncover a deep-layer attention grabbing mechanism: backdoors redirect late-stage attention and form compact embedding clusters near the clean manifold. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Bera, a test-time backdoor erasure framework that detects tokens with anomalous attention via latent-space localization, masks suspicious regions using deep-layer cues, and reconstructs a trigger-free image to break the trigger-unsafe-action mapping while restoring correct behavior. Unlike prior defenses, Bera requires neither retraining of VLAs nor any changes to the training pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple embodied platforms and tasks show that Bera effectively maintains nominal performance, significantly reduces attack success rates, and consistently restores benign behavior from backdoored outputs, thereby offering a robust and practical defense mechanism for securing robotic systems."}

This kinematics only method to estimate and decompose GRF makes it well suited for widespread clinical depolyment. By using kinematics from sixteen body segments, we estimate the centre of mass (CoM) and compute GRFs, which are subsequently decomposed into individual components through a minimization-based approach.

The proposed method employs a two-layer architecture, where the upper layer performs long-term planning, while a set of lower-layer models learn individual motion primitives, which are combined according to specific proportions. Three model variants are introduced to explore different trade-offs between learning flexibility, computational cost, and adaptability: a learning-based proportion model, a sampling-based proportion model, and a playback-based proportion model, which differ in how the proportions are determined and whether the upper layer is trainable. Through real-robot pick-and-place experiments, the proposed models successfully generated complex motions not included in the primitive set. The sampling-based and playback-based proportion models achieved more stable and adaptable motion generation than the standard hierarchical model, demonstrating the effectiveness of proportion-based motion integration for practical robot learning."}

In this paper, we address humanoid skateboarding, a highly challenging task requiring stable dynamic maneuvering on an underactuated wheeled platform. This integrated system is governed by non-holonomic constraints and tightly coupled human-object interactions. Successfully executing this task requires simultaneous mastery of hybrid contact dynamics and robust balance control on a mechanically coupled, dynamically unstable skateboard. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose HUSKY, a learning-based framework that integrates humanoid-skateboard system modeling and physics-aware whole-body control. We first model the coupling relationship between board tilt and truck steering angles, enabling a principled analysis of system dynamics. Building upon this, HUSKY leverages Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to learn human-like pushing motions and employs a physics-guided, heading-oriented strategy for lean-to-steer behaviors. Moreover, a trajectory-guided mechanism ensures smooth and stable transitions between pushing and steering. Experimental results on the Unitree G1 humanoid platform demonstrate that our framework enables stable and agile maneuvering on skateboards in real-world scenarios.

To address these challenges, we propose a depth completion model that trains on synthetic data and uses extremely sparse measurements from depth sensors to predict dense metric depth in unseen field robotics environments. A synthetic dataset generation pipeline tailored to field robotics enables the creation of multiple realistic datasets for training purposes. This dataset generation approach utilizes textured 3D meshes from Structure from Motion and photorealistic rendering with novel viewpoint synthesis to simulate diverse field robotics scenarios. Our approach achieves an end-to-end latency of 53 ms per frame on a Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin, enabling real-time deployment on embedded platforms.

Optical tactile sensors have emerged as promising solutions, as they are immune to electromagnetic interference and have high spatial resolution.

In this study, we present a thin, compact, and soft optical tactile sensor featuring an alignment-free configuration. The soft optical sensor operates by capturing deformation-induced changes in speckle patterns generated within a soft silicone material, thereby enabling precise force measurements and texture recognition via machine learning. The experimental results show a root-mean-square error of 40 mN in the force measurement and a classification accuracy of 93.33% over nine classes of textured surfaces, including Mahjong tiles. The proposed speckle-based approach provides a compact, easily fabricated, and mechanically compliant platform that bridges optical sensing with flexible shape-adaptive architectures, thereby demonstrating its potential as a novel tactile-sensing paradigm for soft robotics and wearable haptic interfaces."}

Leveraging this geometric regularization, we develop iDCOL, an implicit differentiable collision detection and contact kinematics framework. iDCOL represents colliding bodies using strictly convex implicit surfaces and computes collision detection and contact kinematics by solving a fixed-size nonlinear system derived from a geometric scaling-based convex optimization formulation. By applying the Implicit Function Theorem to the resulting system residual, we derive analytical derivatives of the contact kinematic quantities. We develop a fast Newton-based solver for iDCOL and provide an open-source C++ implementation of the framework.

This study introduces a Force-Distributed Line Contact (FDLC) model in contact-rich manipulation and compares it against conventional point contact models. A bi-level optimization framework is constructed, in which the lower-level solves an optimization problem for contact force computation, and the upper-level optimization applies iLQR for trajectory optimization. Through this framework, the limitations of point contact are demon- strated, and the benefits of the FDLC in generating efficient and robust trajectories are established. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by a box rotating task, demonstrating that FDLC enables trajectories generated via non-uniform force distributions along the contact line, while requiring lower control effort and less motion of the robot."}

Deep learning controllers based on gated recurrent units (GRUs) for simultaneous tip position and orientation control, effectively handling the nonlinear coupling between continuum segments, were proposed. The GRU controller was benchmarked against Jacobian based inverse kinematics, model predictive control (MPC), a feedforward neural network (FNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network.

For orientation control at a fixed position (four target poses), the GRU attained a mean RMSE of 0.14 mm and 0.72°, outperforming all alternatives. In a peg transfer task, the GRU achieved a 100% success rate (120 success/120 attempts) with an average transfer time of 11.8s, the STD significantly outperforms novice-controlled systems. Additionally, an ex vivo ESD demonstration grasping, elevating, and resecting tissue as the scalpel completed the cut confirmed that DESectBot provides sufficient stiffness to divide thick gastric mucosa and an operative workspace adequate for large lesions.These results confirm that GRU-based control significantly enhances precision, reliability, and usability in ESD surgical training scenarios."}

As learning becomes increasingly personalized, considering individual learner characteristics becomes more important. This study investigates the moderating effect of spatial ability on learning experience with AR in the context of robot programming. A between-subjects experiment ($N=71$) compared conventional robot programming to an AR-assisted approach using a head-mounted display. Participants' spatial ability was assessed using the Mental Rotation Test. The learning experience was measured through the System Usability Scale (SUS) and cognitive load. The results indicate that AR support does not significantly improve the learning experience compared to the conventional approach. However, AR appears to have a compensatory effect on the influence of spatial ability. In the control group, spatial ability was significantly positively associated with SUS scores and negatively associated with extraneous cognitive load, indicating that higher spatial ability predicts a better learning experience. In the AR condition, these relationships were not observable, suggesting that AR mitigated the disadvantage typically experienced by learners with lower spatial abilities. These findings suggest that AR can serve a compensatory function by reducing the influence of learner characteristics. Future research should further explore this compensatory role of AR to guide the design of personalized learning environments that address diverse learner needs and reduce barriers for learners with varying cognitive profiles."}

One challenge lies in addressing interaction-awareness. Most existing approaches oversimplify interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding agents, and often neglect interactions among the agents themselves. A common solution is to model these interactions using classical game theory. However, its formulation assumes rational players, whereas human behavior is frequently uncertain or irrational. To address these challenges, we propose the Quantum Game Decision-Making (QGDM) model, a novel framework that combines classical game theory with quantum mechanics principles (such as superposition, entanglement, and interference) to tackle multi-player, multi-strategy decision-making problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to apply quantum game theory to decision-making for automated driving. QGDM runs in real time on a standard computer, without requiring quantum hardware.

Despite advancements in autonomy, these robots often struggle to perform reliably in dynamic and unstructured environments and require human intervention to recover from failures. Effective human-robot collaboration is essential to enable robots to receive assistance from the most competent operator, in order to reduce their workload and minimize disruptions in task execution. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for allocating robotic failures to human operators (ARFA). Our proposed approach models the capabilities of human operators, and continuously updates these beliefs based on their actual performance for failure recovery. For every failure to be resolved, a reward function calculates expected outcomes based on operator capabilities and historical data, task urgency, and current workload distribution. The failure is then assigned to the operator with the highest expected reward. Our simulations and user studies show that ARFA outperforms random allocation, significantly reducing robot idle time, improving overall system performance, and leading to a more distributed workload among operators."}

Video: https://youtu.be/lgX2J-00TRM", "summary": "We address dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects by presenting SPiD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework that couples an accurate deformable object model with an augmented self-supervised training strategy. On the modeling side, we extend a mass-spring model to more accurately capture object dynamics while remaining lightweight enough for high-throughput rollouts during self-supervised learning. On the learning side, we train a neural controller using a task-oriented cost, enabling end-to-end optimization through interaction with the differentiable object model. In addition, we propose a self-supervised DAgger variant that detects distribution shift during deployment and performs offline self-correction to further enhance robustness without expert supervision. We evaluate our method primarily on the rope stabilization task, where a robot must bring a swinging rope to rest as quickly and smoothly as possible. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves fast and smooth rope stabilization, generalizing across unseen initial states, rope lengths, masses, non-uniform mass distributions, and external disturbances. Additionally, we develop an affordable markerless rope perception method and demonstrate that our controller maintains performance with noisy and low-frequency state updates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the framework by extending it to the rope trajectory tracking task. Overall, SPiD offers a data-efficient, robust, and physically grounded framework for dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects, featuring strong sim-to-real generalization."}

To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid variance-reduced MPPI framework that integrates a prior model into the sampling process. Our key insight is to decompose the objective function into a known approximate model and a residual term. Since the residual captures only the discrepancy between the model and the objective, it typically exhibits a smaller magnitude and lower variance than the original objective. Although this principle applies to general modeling choices, we demonstrate that adopting a quadratic approximation enables the derivation of a closed-form, model-guided prior that effectively concentrates samples in informative regions. Crucially, the framework is agnostic to the source of geometric information, allowing the quadratic model to be constructed from exact derivatives, structural approximations (e.g., Gauss- or Quasi-Newton), or gradient-free randomized smoothing. We validate the approach on standard optimization benchmarks, a nonlinear, underactuated cart-pole control task, and a contact-rich manipulation problem with non-smooth dynamics. Across these domains, we achieve faster convergence and superior performance in low-sample regimes compared to standard MPPI. These results suggest that the method can make sample-based control strategies more practical in scenarios where obtaining samples is expensive or limited."}

To make VLA pretraining effective, latent actions should contain information about the underlying agent's actions despite the absence of ground-truth labels. We propose \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}iew\\textbf{P}oint \\textbf{L}atent \\textbf{A}ction \\textbf{M}odel (\\textbf{MVP-LAM}), which learns discrete latent actions that are highly informative about ground-truth actions from time-synchronized multi-view videos. MVP-LAM trains latent actions with a \\emph{cross-viewpoint reconstruction} objective, so that a latent action inferred from one view must explain the future in another view, reducing reliance on viewpoint-specific cues. On Bridge V2, MVP-LAM produces more action-centric latent actions, achieving higher mutual information with ground-truth actions and improved action prediction, including under out-of-distribution evaluation. Finally, pretraining VLAs with MVP-LAM latent actions improves downstream manipulation performance on the SIMPLER and LIBERO-Long benchmarks."}

Most existing approaches decouple perception from representation, treating the scene graph as a derivative layer generated post hoc. This limits both consistency and scalability. In contrast, we propose a mapping architecture where the 3DSSG serves as the foundational backend, acting as the primary knowledge representation for the entire mapping process.\n  Our approach leverages prior work on incremental scene graph prediction to infer and update the graph structure in real-time as the environment is explored. This ensures that the map remains topologically consistent and computationally efficient, even during extended operations in large-scale settings. By maintaining an explicit, spatially grounded representation that supports both flat and hierarchical topologies, we bridge the gap between sub-symbolic raw sensor data and high-level symbolic reasoning. Consequently, this provides a stable, verifiable structure that knowledge-driven frameworks, ranging from knowledge graphs and ontologies to Large Language Models (LLMs), can directly exploit, enabling agents to operate with enhanced interpretability, trustworthiness, and alignment to human concepts."}

However, they still face key challenges: a misalignment between coordinate-space actions and pixel-space videos, sensitivity to camera viewpoint, and non-unified architectures across embodiments. To this end, we present BridgeV2W, which converts coordinate-space actions into pixel-aligned embodiment masks rendered from the URDF and camera parameters. These masks are then injected into a pretrained video generation model via a ControlNet-style pathway, which aligns the action control signals with predicted videos, adds view-specific conditioning to accommodate camera viewpoints, and yields a unified world model architecture across embodiments. To mitigate overfitting to static backgrounds, BridgeV2W further introduces a flow-based motion loss that focuses on learning dynamic and task-relevant regions. Experiments on single-arm (DROID) and dual-arm (AgiBot-G1) datasets, covering diverse and challenging conditions with unseen viewpoints and scenes, show that BridgeV2W improves video generation quality compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the potential of BridgeV2W on downstream real-world tasks, including policy evaluation and goal-conditioned planning.

However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines conformal prediction with reachability analysis. In particular, we use conformal prediction to obtain valid uncertainty intervals for the unknown dynamics at each time step, with reachability then verifying whether safety is maintained within the conformal uncertainty bounds. Next, we develop an algorithmic approach for training control policies that optimize nominal reward while also maximizing the planning horizon with sound probabilistic safety guarantees. We evaluate the proposed approach in seven safe control settings spanning four domains -- cartpole, lane following, drone control, and safe navigation -- for both affine and nonlinear safety specifications. Our experiments show that the policies we learn achieve the strongest provable safety guarantees while still maintaining high average reward."}
