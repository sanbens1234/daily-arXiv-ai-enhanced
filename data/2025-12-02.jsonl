MAPF has wide applications in domains like automated warehouses, manufacturing systems, and airport logistics. However, most MAPF formulations assume a simplified robot model for planning, which overlooks execution-time factors such as kinodynamic constraints, communication latency, and controller variability. This gap between planning and execution is problematic for time-sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, we propose REMAP, an execution-informed MAPF planning framework that can be combined with leading search-based MAPF planners with minor changes. Our framework integrates the proposed ExecTimeNet to accurately estimate execution time based on planned paths. We demonstrate our method for solving MAPF with Real-world Deadlines (MAPF-RD) problem, where agents must reach their goals before a predefined wall-clock time. We integrate our framework with two popular MAPF methods, MAPF-LNS and CBS. Experiments show that REMAP achieves up to 20% improvement in solution quality over baseline methods (e.g., constant execution speed estimators) on benchmark maps with up to 300 agents."}

While existing tools have demonstrated value, many publicly available solutions are tightly coupled to specific simulators, difficult to extend, or introduce significant technical overhead. For example, CARLA-the most widely used open-source AV simulator-provides a digital twin framework implemented entirely as an Unreal Engine C++ plugin, limiting flexibility and rapid prototyping. In this work, we propose OpenTwinMap, an open-source, Python-based framework for generating high-fidelity 3D urban digital twins. The completed framework will ingest LiDAR scans and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to produce semantically segmented static environment assets, including road networks, terrain, and urban structures, which can be exported into Unreal Engine for AV simulation. OpenTwinMap emphasizes extensibility and parallelization, lowering the barrier for researchers to adapt and scale the pipeline to diverse urban contexts. We describe the current capabilities of the OpenTwinMap, which includes preprocessing of OSM and LiDAR data, basic road mesh and terrain generation, and preliminary support for CARLA integration."}

This difficulty mainly arises because most existing planning frameworks operate in an open-loop manner, making it hard to cope with environmental uncertainties such as wind disturbances or external perturbations. This paper presents a unified real-time navigation framework for quadrotors in unknown complex environments, based on the online construction of guiding vector fields (GVFs) from discrete reference path points. In the framework, onboard perception modules build a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) representation of the environment, which enables obstacle awareness and path distance evaluation. The system first generates discrete, collision-free path points using a global planner, and then parameterizes them via uniform B-splines to produce a smooth and physically feasible reference trajectory. An adaptive GVF is then synthesized from the ESDF and the optimized B-spline trajectory. Unlike conventional approaches, the method adopts a closed-loop navigation paradigm, which significantly enhances robustness under external disturbances. Compared with conventional GVF methods, the proposed approach directly accommodates discretized paths and maintains compatibility with standard planning algorithms. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved robustness against external disturbances and superior real-time performance."}

We propose Soft-Nash Virtual Fixtures, a game-theoretic shared-control policy that softens the classic two-player linear-quadratic (LQ) Nash solution by inflating the fixture's effort weight with a single, interpretable scalar parameter $τ$. This yields a continuous dial on controller assertiveness: $τ=0$ recovers a hard, performance-focused Nash / virtual fixture controller, while larger $τ$ reduce gains and pushback, yet preserve the equilibrium structure and continuity of closed-loop stability. We derive Soft-Nash from both a KL-regularized trust-region and a maximum-entropy viewpoint, obtaining a closed-form robot best response that shrinks authority and aligns the fixture with the operator's input as $τ$ grows. We implement Soft-Nash on a 6-DoF haptic device in 3D tracking task ($n=12$). Moderate softness ($τ\\approx 1-3$, especially $τ=2$) maintains tracking error statistically indistinguishable from a tuned classic VF while sharply reducing controller-user conflict, lowering NASA-TLX workload, and increasing Sense of Agency (SoAS). A composite BalancedScore that combines normalized accuracy and non-fighting behavior peaks near $τ=2-3$. These results show that a one-parameter Soft-Nash policy can preserve accuracy while improving comfort and perceived agency, providing a practical and interpretable pathway to personalized shared control in haptics and teleoperation."}

We explore the biological basis of hand synergies and human gesture analysis, translating joint-level coordination and structural attributes into a modular finger architecture. Leveraging these biomimetic mappings, we design a five-finger modular hand and establish its kinematic model to analyze adaptive grasping and in-hand manipulation. Finally, we construct a physical prototype and conduct preliminary experiments, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed design and analysis."}

To address this gap, we propose a Fusion-based Affordance Keypoint Network (FAKP-Net) by introducing 3D keypoint quadruplet that harnesses the synergistic potential of RGB and Depth image to provide information on execution position, direction, and extent. Benchmark testing demonstrates that FAKP-Net outperforms existing models by significant margins in affordance segmentation task and keypoint detection task. Real-world experiments also showcase the reliability of our method in accomplishing manipulation tasks with previously unseen objects."}

Robots employ a conjugate prior to gradually predict the times between events and derive confidence estimates to adapt their behavior. Our simulation results show that the robot swarm consistently chooses the correct area while reducing exposure to hazardous events by being sample-efficient.

Adaptive Resonance Theory-based Topological Clustering with Different Topologies (ATC-DT) builds global topological maps represented as graphs while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during sequential processing. However, its winner selection mechanism relies on an exhaustive nearest-neighbor search over all existing nodes, leading to scalability limitations as the map grows. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical extension called Multi-Layer ATC (MLATC). MLATC organizes nodes into a hierarchy, enabling the nearest-neighbor search to proceed from coarse to fine resolutions, thereby drastically reducing the number of distance evaluations per query. The number of layers is not fixed in advance. MLATC employs an adaptive layer addition mechanism that automatically deepens the hierarchy when lower layers become saturated, keeping the number of user-defined hyperparameters low. Simulation experiments on synthetic large-scale environments show that MLATC accelerates topological map building compared to the original ATC-DT and exhibits a sublinear, approximately logarithmic scaling of search time with respect to the number of nodes. Experiments on campus-scale real-world LiDAR datasets confirm that MLATC maintains a millisecond-level per-frame runtime and enables real-time global topological map building in large-scale environments, significantly outperforming the original ATC-DT in terms of computational efficiency."}

When the control chamber in the valve is pressurized, the main path is compressed along its central axis, buckling and being pressed,resulting in blockage. This allows control by a pressure signal smaller than that within the main channel. Furthermore, similar to transistors in electrical circuits, when combined, the proposed valve can perform a variety of logical operations. The basic type operates as a NOT logic element, which is named the fluidic sheet transistor (FST). By integrating multiple FSTs, logical operations such as positive logic, NAND, and NOR can be performed on a single sheet. This paper describes the operating principle, fabrication method, and characteristics of the FST,followed by a method for configuring logical operations.Moreover, we demonstrate the construction of a latch circuit(self-holding logic circuit) using FST, introducing a prototype of a fluid robot system that combines a tactile tube as a fluidic detector and fluid actuators. This demonstrates that it is possible to generate behavior that actively changes posture when hitting an obstacle using only air pressure from a single pipe, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed methods."}

Ackermann steering further imposes curvature bounds and forbids in-place rotation, so escaping from narrow dead ends typically requires tightly sequenced forward and reverse maneuvers. Classical planners that decouple global search and local steering struggle in these settings because narrow passages occupy low-measure regions and nonholonomic reachability shrinks the set of valid connections, which degrades sampling efficiency and increases sensitivity to clearances. We study nonholonomic narrow dead-end escape for Ackermann vehicles and contribute three components. First, we construct a generator that samples multi-phase forward-reverse trajectories compatible with Ackermann kinematics and inflates their envelopes to synthesize families of narrow dead ends that are guaranteed to admit at least one feasible escape. Second, we construct a training environment that enforces kinematic constraints and train a policy using the soft actor-critic algorithm. Third, we evaluate against representative classical planners that combine global search with nonholonomic steering. Across parameterized dead-end families, the learned policy solves a larger fraction of instances, reduces maneuver count, and maintains comparable path length and planning time while under the same sensing and control limits.

A Task Manager LLM interprets natural-language goals, classifies tasks, and allocates subtasks using static rules plus dynamic contexts (task, history, robot and task status, and events).Each robot runs a local LLM that composes executable Python code from primitive skills (ROS2 nodes, policies), while onboard perception (VLMs/image processing) continuously monitors events and classifies them into relevant or irrelevant to the task. Task failures or user intent changes trigger replanning, allowing robots to assist teammates, resume tasks, or request human help. Hardware studies demonstrate autonomous recovery from disruptive events, filtering of irrelevant distractions, and tightly coordinated transport with emergent human-robot cooperation (e.g., multirobot collaborative object recovery success rate: 9/10, coordinated transport: 8/8, human-assisted recovery: 5/5).Simulation studies show intention-aware replanning. A curated textual benchmark spanning 22 scenarios (3 tasks each, around 20 robots) evaluates task allocation, classification, IoU, executability, and correctness, with high average scores (e.g., correctness up to 0.91) across multiple LLMs, a separate replanning set (5 scenarios) achieves 1.0 correctness.

However, most prior approaches update their world representation only at discrete update points such as navigation targets, waypoints, or the end of an action step, leaving robots blind between updates and causing cascading failures: overlooked objects, late error detection, and delayed replanning. To address this limitation, we propose BINDER (Bridging INstant and DEliberative Reasoning), a dual process framework that decouples strategic planning from continuous environment monitoring. Specifically, BINDER integrates a Deliberative Response Module (DRM, a multimodal LLM for task planning) with an Instant Response Module (IRM, a VideoLLM for continuous monitoring). The two modules play complementary roles: the DRM performs strategic planning with structured 3D scene updates and guides what the IRM attends to, while the IRM analyzes video streams to update memory, correct ongoing actions, and trigger replanning when necessary. Through this bidirectional coordination, the modules address the trade off between maintaining awareness and avoiding costly updates, enabling robust adaptation under dynamic conditions. Evaluated in three real world environments with dynamic object placement, BINDER achieves substantially higher success and efficiency than SoTA baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for real world deployment."}

Our experiments show that the expressiveness of the fused latent space is largely induced by the enforced complementarity from modality-wise dropout, with cross-attention serving primarily as a lightweight interaction mechanism rather than the main source of robustness.

Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages. We provide comprehensive empirical and experimental validation demonstrating the effectiveness of this paradigm. RealD$^2$iff enables two key applications: (1) generating real-world-like depth to construct clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection.

To address this challenge, we introduce the LIBERO-Elegant benchmark with explicit criteria for evaluating execution quality. Using these criteria, we develop a decoupled refinement framework that improves execution quality without modifying or retraining the base VLA policy. We formalize Elegant Execution as the satisfaction of Implicit Task Constraints (ITCs) and train an Elegance Critic via offline Calibrated Q-Learning to estimate the expected quality of candidate actions. At inference time, a Just-in-Time Intervention (JITI) mechanism monitors critic confidence and intervenes only at decision-critical moments, providing selective, on-demand refinement. Experiments on LIBERO-Elegant and real-world manipulation tasks show that the learned Elegance Critic substantially improves execution quality, even on unseen tasks.

Yet, these methods mostly rely on egocentric (first-person) perception, limiting their performance, especially when the viewpoint of the robot is occluded. A promising solution would be to enhance the robot's environmental awareness by using complementary viewpoints, such as multiple actors exchanging perceptual information. Inspired by this idea, this work proposes a multi-view depth-based locomotion framework that combines egocentric and exocentric observations to provide richer environmental context during agile locomotion. Using a teacher-student distillation approach, the student policy learns to fuse proprioception with dual depth streams while remaining robust to real-world sensing imperfections. To further improve robustness, we introduce extensive domain randomization, including stochastic remote-camera dropouts and 3D positional perturbations that emulate aerial-ground cooperative sensing. Simulation results show that multi-viewpoints policies outperform single-viewpoint baseline in gap crossing, step descent, and other dynamic maneuvers, while maintaining stability when the exocentric camera is partially or completely unavailable. Additional experiments show that moderate viewpoint misalignment is well tolerated when incorporated during training. This study demonstrates that heterogeneous visual feedback improves robustness and agility in quadrupedal locomotion.

However, achieving optimal performance following this regiment requires a large-scale dataset, which is costly to obtain, especially for challenging tasks, such as collision avoidance. In those tasks, generalization at test time demands coverage of many obstacles types and their spatial configurations, which are impractical to acquire purely via data. To remedy this problem, we propose Context-Aware diffusion policy via Proximal mode Expansion (CAPE), a framework that expands trajectory distribution modes with context-aware prior and guidance at inference via a novel prior-seeded iterative guided refinement procedure. The framework generates an initial trajectory plan and executes a short prefix trajectory, and then the remaining trajectory segment is perturbed to an intermediate noise level, forming a trajectory prior. Such a prior is context-aware and preserves task intent. Repeating the process with context-aware guided denoising iteratively expands mode support to allow finding smoother, less collision-prone trajectories. For collision avoidance, CAPE expands trajectory distribution modes with collision-aware context, enabling the sampling of collision-free trajectories in previously unseen environments while maintaining goal consistency. We evaluate CAPE on diverse manipulation tasks in cluttered unseen simulated and real-world settings and show up to 26% and 80% higher success rates respectively compared to SOTA methods, demonstrating better generalization to unseen environments."}

In this work, we propose an effective and scalable framework, Naturalistic Inpainting for Context Enhancement (NICE). Our method minimizes out-of-distribution (OOD) gap in imitation learning by increasing visual diversity through construction of new experiences using existing demonstrations. By utilizing image generative frameworks and large language models, NICE performs three editing operations, object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting (non-target) objects. These changes preserve spatial relationships without obstructing target objects and maintain action-label consistency. Unlike previous approaches, NICE requires no additional robot data collection, simulator access, or custom model training, making it readily applicable to existing robotic datasets.\n  Using real-world scenes, we showcase the capability of our framework in producing photo-realistic scene enhancement. For downstream tasks, we use NICE data to finetune a vision-language model (VLM) for spatial affordance prediction and a vision-language-action (VLA) policy for object manipulation. Our evaluations show that NICE successfully minimizes OOD gaps, resulting in over 20% improvement in accuracy for affordance prediction in highly cluttered scenes. For manipulation tasks, success rate increases on average by 11% when testing in environments populated with distractors in different quantities.

Using this measure, we systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world and conduct extensive experimentation on manipulation policies, in particular vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our experiments highlight the significant impact of scene clutter, lowering the performance of the policies, by as much as 34% and show that despite achieving similar average performance across the tasks, different VLA policies have unique vulnerabilities and a relatively low agreement on success scenarios. We further show that our clutter measure is an effective indicator of performance degradation and analyze the impact of distractors in terms of their quantity and occluding influence. At the end, we show that finetuning on enhanced data, although effective, does not equally remedy all negative impacts of clutter on performance."}

The trajectory planning problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using a constrained iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm that jointly optimizes trajectory smoothness, control effort, and risk exposure while maintaining strict feasibility. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of safety and efficiency, achieving collision-free trajectories with shorter lane-changing distances (28.59 m) and times (2.84 s) while maintaining smooth and comfortable acceleration patterns. In dense roundabout environments the planner further demonstrates robust adaptability, producing larger safety margins, lower jerk, and superior curvature smoothness compared with APF, MPC, and RRT based baselines. These results confirm that the integrated DRF with convex feasible space and constrained iLQR solver provides a balanced solution for safe, efficient, and comfortable trajectory generation in dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios."}

Our method produces a dense, uncertainty-aware drivability map that captures both semantic structure and geometric layout at pixel-level resolution. To further promote safe and rule-compliant behavior, we introduce a lane-following regularization that encodes lane structure and traffic norms. This prior stabilizes trajectory planning under normal conditions while preserving the flexibility needed for maneuvers such as overtaking or lane changes. Together, these components enable robust and interpretable trajectory planning, even under challenging uncertainty conditions. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering substantial gains on both the challenging NAVHARD and NAVSAFE subsets.

Recognizing these precursors requires strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, which are often absent in current AV systems due to the scarcity of such cases in existing driving or risk-centric datasets. Moreover, current autonomous driving accident datasets often lack annotations of the causal reasoning chains behind incidents, which are essential for identifying potential risks before they become observable.

Unlike prior works, incorporating action predictions (e.g., gripper or hand trajectories and orientations) allows the model to capture richer physical priors such as real-world distances and orientations, thereby enabling seamless transferability to downstream tasks. We further decompose the latent actions into learnable motion and scene tokens to distinguish the robot's active movements from environmental changes, thus filtering out irrelevant dynamics.

Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs.

Calibration of road networks in microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena such as traffic waves for large-scale simulation is a process that is fraught with challenges. This work reconsiders the existence of the traffic state data as boundary conditions on an ego vehicle moving through previously recorded traffic data, rather than reproducing those traffic phenomena in a calibrated microsim. Our approach is to autogenerate a 1 mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, and use the I-24 data to power a cosimulation module that injects traffic information into the simulation. The CARLA and cosimulation simulations are centered around an ego vehicle sampled from the empirical data, with autogeneration of \"visible\" traffic within the longitudinal range of the ego vehicle. Boundary control beyond these visible ranges is achieved using ghost cells behind (upstream) and ahead (downstream) of the ego vehicle. Unlike prior simulation work that focuses on local car-following behavior or abstract geometries, our framework targets full time-space diagram fidelity as the validation objective. Leveraging CARLA's rich sensor suite and configurable vehicle dynamics, we simulate wave formation and dissipation in both low-congestion and high-congestion scenarios for qualitative analysis. The resulting emergent behavior closely mirrors that of real traffic, providing a novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and future deployment of wave mitigation solutions.

Integrating bio-inspired design principles into linear actuators could bring forth the next generation of adaptive and energy efficient smart material-based actuation systems. The present study amalgamates the advantages of bipenniform architecture, which generates high force in the given physiological region and a high power-to-weight ratio of shape memory alloy (SMA), into a novel bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator. A mathematical model of a multi-layered bipenniform configuration-based SMA actuator was developed and validated experimentally. The current research also caters to the incorporation of failure mitigation strategies using design failure mode and effects analysis along with the experimental assessment of the performance of the developed actuator. The system has been benchmarked against an industry-developed stepper motor-driven actuator. It has shown promising results generating an actuation force of 257 N with 15 V input voltage, meeting the acceptable range for actuation operation. It further exhibits about 67% reduction in the weight of the drive mechanism, with 80% lesser component, 32% cost reduction, and 19% energy savings and similar envelope dimensions for assembly compatibility with dampers and louvers for easy onsite deployment. The study introduces SMA coil-based actuator as an advanced design that can be deployed for high force-high stroke applications. The bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator has applications ranging from building automation controls to lightweight actuation systems for space robotics and medical prosthesis."}

Existing approaches to disassembly sequence planning often assume deterministic and fully observable product models, yet real EOL products frequently deviate from their initial designs due to wear, corrosion, or undocumented repairs. We argue that disassembly should therefore be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which naturally captures uncertainty about the product's internal state. We present a mathematical formulation of disassembly as a POMDP, in which hidden variables represent uncertain structural or physical properties. Building on this formulation, we propose a task and motion planning framework that automatically derives specific POMDP models from CAD data, robot capabilities, and inspection results. To obtain tractable policies, we approximate this formulation with a reinforcement-learning approach that operates on stochastic action outcomes informed by inspection priors, while a Bayesian filter continuously maintains beliefs over latent EOL conditions during execution. Using three products on two robotic systems, we demonstrate that this probabilistic planning framework outperforms deterministic baselines in terms of average disassembly time and variance, generalizes across different robot setups, and successfully adapts to deviations from the CAD model, such as missing or stuck parts."}
