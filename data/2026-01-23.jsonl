This systematic review synthesizes (1) the behavior change strategies used in existing HRI studies employing social robots to promote health behavior change, and (2) the evaluation methods applied to assess behavior change outcomes. Relevant literature was identified through systematic database searches and hand searches. Analysis of 39 studies revealed four overarching categories of behavior change strategies: coaching strategies, counseling strategies, social influence strategies, and persuasion-enhancing strategies. These strategies highlight the unique affordances of social robots as behavior change interventions and offer valuable design heuristics. The review also identified key characteristics of current evaluation practices, including study designs, settings, durations, and outcome measures, on the basis of which we propose several directions for future HRI research."}

Furthermore, this research provides important references for the fields of biomimetic robots and magnetically controlled micro-soft robots", "summary": "In narrow, unstructured underwater environments such as environmental monitoring and minimally invasive medical procedures, micro soft robots exhibit unique advantages due to their flexible movement capabilities and small size. At the same time, applying bionic technology to the structural design of micro soft robots can significantly improve their swimming performance. However, limited by their miniaturization, these robots are difficult to power internally and usually adopt a wireless power supply method. This study designs and fabricates a magnetically responsive, cownose ray-inspired micro soft robot based on the swimming principle of the cownose ray. The robot is made of a certain proportion of NdFeB and PDMS. Then, a three-dimensional Helmholtz coil is used to generate an oscillating harmonic magnetic field to conduct swimming experiments on the robot, exploring the influence of magnetic field parameters on the robot's swimming performance. The experimental results show that the swimming speed is the fastest at B = 5 mT and f = 11 Hz, reaching 5.25 mm/s, which is about 0.5 body lengths per second. In addition, by adjusting the current direction and frequency of the coil, the robot can perform different swimming modes such as straight swimming, turning swimming, and directional swimming. By employing a stepwise adjustment method, the impact of response errors on the robot's trajectory can be effectively reduced. This study demonstrates a method for magnetically driven micro soft robots, laying a foundation for the application of wireless-driven robots in underwater narrow spaces."}

Our method proceeds in two stages: first, we construct a decoupled latent space that captures localized motion patterns across different body parts using contrastive learning, enabling accurate and flexible motion retargeting even across robots with diverse morphologies. To enhance alignment between embodiments, we introduce tailored similarity metrics that combine joint rotation and end-effector positioning for critical segments, such as arms. Then, we train a goal-conditioned control policy directly within this latent space using only human data. Leveraging a conditional variational autoencoder, our policy learns to predict latent space displacements guided by intended goal directions. We show that the trained policy can be directly deployed on multiple robots without any adaptation. Furthermore, our method supports the efficient addition of new robots to the latent space by learning only a lightweight, robot-specific embedding layer. The learned latent policies can also be directly applied to the new robots. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables robust, scalable, and embodiment-agnostic robot control across a wide range of humanoid platforms."}

By combining analytical modeling, real-time simulation, and machine learning, the framework offers a robust solution for ensuring safe robotic operations. An analytical model was developed to estimate the minimum distances between robotic arms based on their joint configurations, offering precise theoretical calculations that serve as both a validation tool and a benchmark. To complement this, a 3D simulation environment was created to model two 7-DOF Kinova robotic arms, generating a diverse dataset of configurations for collision detection and distance estimation. Using these insights, a deep neural network model was trained with joint actuators of robot arms and relative positions as inputs, achieving a mean absolute error of 282.2 mm and an R-squared value of 0.85. The close alignment between predicted and actual distances highlights the network's accuracy and its ability to generalize spatial relationships.

Large language models (LLMs) can be advantageous if trained at scale on general knowledge, but especially and in particular when the training data includes information such as detailed map geography topology of the entire planet, as well as the ability to access real time situational data such as weather. However, challenges remain in the interface between drones and LLMs in general, with each application requiring a tedious, labor intensive effort to connect the LLM trained knowledge to drone command and control. Here, we solve that problem, using an interface strategy that is LLM agnostic and drone agnostic, providing the first universal, versatile, comprehensive and easy to use drone control interface. We do this using the new model context protocol (MCP) standard, an open standard that provides a universal way for AI systems to access external data, tools, and services. We develop and deploy a cloud based Linux machine hosting an MCP server that supports the Mavlink protocol, an ubiquitous drone control language used almost universally by millions of drones including Ardupilot and PX4 framework.We demonstrate flight control of a real unmanned aerial vehicle. In further testing, we demonstrate extensive flight planning and control capability in a simulated drone, integrated with a Google Maps MCP server for up to date, real time navigation information. This demonstrates a universal approach to integration of LLMs with drone command and control, a paradigm that leverages and exploits virtually all of modern AI industry with drone technology in an easy to use interface that translates natural language to drone control."}

In the proposed CompliantVLA-adaptor, a VLM interprets task context from images and natural language to adapt the stiffness and damping parameters of a VIC controller. These parameters are further regulated using real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the VLA baselines on a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware, with improved success rates and reduced force violations.

However, controlling these robots is a major challenge. Stationary magnetic systems have a limited workspace, while mobile systems (e.g., coils on a robotic arm) suffer from a \"model-calibration bottleneck\", requiring complex, pre-calibrated physical models that are time-consuming to create and computationally expensive. This paper presents a compact, low-cost mobile magnetic manipulation platform that overcomes this limitation using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our system features a compact four-electromagnet array mounted on a UR5 collaborative robot. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based control strategy is trained through a sim-to-real pipeline, enabling effective policy deployment within 15 minutes and significantly reducing setup time. We validated the platform by controlling a 7-mm magnetic capsule along 2D trajectories. Our DRL-based controller achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.18~mm for a square path and 1.50~mm for a circular path. We also demonstrated successful tracking over a clinically relevant, 30 cm * 20 cm workspace.

Plume tracking on small quadrotors would allow these systems to operate around humans and fly in more confined spaces, but can be challenging due to poor sensitivity and long response times from gas sensors that fit on small quadrotors. In this work, we present an approach to complement chemical plume tracking with airflow source-seeking behavior using a custom flow sensor that can sense both airflow magnitude and direction on small quadrotors < 100 g. We use this sensor to implement a modified version of the `Cast and Surge' algorithm that takes advantage of flow direction sensing to find and navigate towards flow sources. A series of characterization experiments verified that the system can detect airflow while in flight and reorient the quadrotor toward the airflow. Several trials with random starting locations and orientations were used to show that our source-seeking algorithm can reliably find a flow source. This work aims to provide a foundation for future platforms that can use flow sensors in concert with other sensors to enable richer plume tracking data collection and source-seeking."}

In this paper, we propose AION for vision-based aerial ObjectNav without relying on external localization or global maps. AION is an end-to-end dual-policy reinforcement learning (RL) framework that decouples exploration and goal-reaching behaviors into two specialized policies. We evaluate AION on the AI2-THOR benchmark and further assess its real-time performance in IsaacSim using high-fidelity drone models.

Su"], "title": "D-Optimality-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Open-Loop Calibration of a 3-DOF Ankle Rehabilitation Robot", "comment": null, "summary": "Accurate alignment of multi-degree-of-freedom rehabilitation robots is essential for safe and effective patient training. This paper proposes a two-stage calibration framework for a self-designed three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) ankle rehabilitation robot. First, a Kronecker-product-based open-loop calibration method is developed to cast the input-output alignment into a linear parameter identification problem, which in turn defines the associated experimental design objective through the resulting information matrix. Building on this formulation, calibration posture selection is posed as a combinatorial design-of-experiments problem guided by a D-optimality criterion, i.e., selecting a small subset of postures that maximises the determinant of the information matrix. To enable practical selection under constraints, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent is trained in simulation to choose 4 informative postures from a candidate set of 50. Across simulation and real-robot evaluations, the learned policy consistently yields substantially more informative posture combinations than random selection: the mean determinant of the information matrix achieved by PPO is reported to be more than two orders of magnitude higher with reduced variance. In addition, real-world results indicate that a parameter vector identified from only four D-optimality-guided postures provides stronger cross-episode prediction consistency than estimates obtained from a larger but unstructured set of 50 postures. The proposed framework therefore improves calibration efficiency while maintaining robust parameter estimation, offering practical guidance for high-precision alignment of multi-DOF rehabilitation robots."}

However, their practical deployment is typically hindered by the inherent difficulty in enforcing vehicle dynamics and a critical reliance on accurate predictions of other agents, making them prone to safety issues under uncertain interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce DualShield, a planning and control framework that leverages Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability value functions in a dual capacity. First, the value functions act as proactive guidance, steering the diffusion denoising process towards safe and dynamically feasible regions. Second, they form a reactive safety shield using control barrier-value functions (CBVFs) to modify the executed actions and ensure safety. This dual mechanism preserves the rich exploration capabilities of diffusion models while providing principled safety assurance under uncertain and even adversarial interactions. Simulations in challenging unprotected U-turn scenarios demonstrate that DualShield significantly improves both safety and task efficiency compared to leading methods from different planning paradigms under uncertainty."}

Glove2UAV streams inertial measurements in real time and estimates palm and finger orientations using a compact processing pipeline that combines median-based outlier suppression with Madgwick-based orientation estimation. The resulting motion estimations are mapped to a small set of control primitives for directional flight (forward/backward and lateral motion) and, when supported by the platform, to object-interaction commands. Vibrotactile feedback is triggered when flight speed exceeds predefined threshold values, providing an additional alert channel during operation. We validate real-time feasibility by synchronizing glove signals with UAV telemetry in both simulation and real-world flights. The results show fast gesture-based command execution, stable coupling between gesture dynamics and platform motion, correct operation of the core command set in our trials, and timely delivery of vibratile warning cues."}

Such operations are critical when surface access is not possible and stealthy navigation is required in restricted environments such as protected zones or dangerous areas under access ban. GNSS denied navigation is then essential to maintaining concealment as surfacing could expose UUVs to detection. To ensure a precise fleet positioning a constellation of beacons deployed by aerial or surface drones establish a synthetic landmark network that will guide the fleet of UUVs along an optimized path from the continental shelf to the goal on the shore. These beacons either submerged or floating emit acoustic signals for UUV localisation and navigation.

To achieve this goal, the humanoid needs to map its perception of surrounding obstacles with diverse spatial layouts and geometries to the corresponding traversal skills. However, the lack of an effective representation that captures humanoid-obstacle relationships during collision avoidance makes directly learning such mappings difficult. We therefore propose Humanoid Potential Field (HumanoidPF), which encodes these relationships as collision-free motion directions, significantly facilitating RL-based traversal skill learning. We also find that HumanoidPF exhibits a surprisingly negligible sim-to-real gap as a perceptual representation. To further enable generalizable traversal skills through diverse and challenging cluttered indoor scenes, we further propose a hybrid scene generation method, incorporating crops of realistic 3D indoor scenes and procedurally synthesized obstacles. We successfully transfer our policy to the real world and develop a teleoperation system where users could command the humanoid to traverse in cluttered indoor scenes with just a single click.

We introduce IVRA, a lightweight, training-free method that improves spatial understanding by exploiting affinity hints already available in the model's built-in vision encoder, without requiring any external encoder or retraining. IVRA selectively injects these affinity signals into a language-model layer in which instance-level features reside. This inference-time intervention realigns visual-token interactions and better preserves geometric structure while keeping all model parameters fixed. We demonstrate the generality of IVRA by applying it to diverse VLA architectures (LLaRA, OpenVLA, and FLOWER) across simulated benchmarks spanning both 2D and 3D manipulation (VIMA and LIBERO) and on various real-robot tasks. On 2D VIMA, IVRA improves average success by +4.2% over the baseline LLaRA in a low-data regime. On 3D LIBERO, it yields consistent gains over the OpenVLA and FLOWER baselines, including improvements when baseline accuracy is near saturation (96.3% to 97.1%). All code and models will be released publicly. Visualizations are available at: jongwoopark7978.github.io/IVRA"}

Simulation and synthetic data generation offer a scalable alternative, but their usefulness is limited by the visual domain gap between simulation and reality. In this work, we present Point Bridge, a framework that leverages unified, domain-agnostic point-based representations to unlock synthetic datasets for zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer, without explicit visual or object-level alignment. Point Bridge combines automated point-based representation extraction via Vision-Language Models (VLMs), transformer-based policy learning, and efficient inference-time pipelines to train capable real-world manipulation agents using only synthetic data. With additional co-training on small sets of real demonstrations, Point Bridge further improves performance, substantially outperforming prior vision-based sim-and-real co-training methods. It achieves up to 44% gains in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and up to 66% with limited real data across both single-task and multitask settings.
