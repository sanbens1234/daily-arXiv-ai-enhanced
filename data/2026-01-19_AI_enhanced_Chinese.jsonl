The survey also discusses community-driven enhancements to the ROS~2 runtime, including new executor algorithm designs, real-time GPU management, and microcontroller support via micro-ROS. Furthermore, we summarize techniques for bounding DDS communication delays, message filters, and profiling tools that have been developed to support analysis and experimentation.

Related to an earlier IEEE ICAR 2021 publication", "summary": "Multi-robot formation control has various applications in domains such as vehicle troops, platoons, payload transportation, and surveillance. Maintaining formation in a vehicle platoon requires designing a suitable control scheme that can tackle external disturbances and uncertain system parameters while maintaining a predefined safe distance between the robots. A crucial challenge in this context is dealing with the unknown/uncertain friction forces between wheels and the ground, which vary with changes in road surface, wear in tires, and speed of the vehicle. Although state-of-the-art adaptive controllers can handle a priori bounded uncertainties, they struggle with accurately modeling and identifying frictional forces, which are often state-dependent and cannot be a priori bounded.\n  This thesis proposes a new adaptive sliding mode controller for wheeled mobile robot-based vehicle platoons that can handle the unknown and complex behavior of frictional forces without prior knowledge of their parameters and structures. The controller uses the adaptive sliding mode control techniques to regulate the platoon's speed and maintain a predefined inter-robot distance, even in the presence of external disturbances and uncertain system parameters. This approach involves a two-stage process: first, the kinematic controller calculates the desired velocities based on the desired trajectory; and second, the dynamics model generates the commands to achieve the desired motion. By separating the kinematics and dynamics of the robot, this approach can simplify the control problem and allow for more efficient and robust control of the wheeled mobile robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "This thesis introduces an adaptive sliding mode controller for vehicle platoons that can manage unknown frictional forces, ensuring safe distances and speed regulation among robots despite external disturbances and uncertain parameters.", "motivation": "The motivation is to address the challenge of maintaining formation in a vehicle platoon, especially when dealing with unpredictable frictional forces that cannot be accurately modeled or bounded by traditional adaptive controllers.

This paper introduces BRIDGE, a system for bidirectional human-robot communication in physical assistance. Our method allows users to modify a robot's planned trajectory -- position, velocity, and force -- in real time using natural language. We utilize a large language model (LLM) to interpret any trajectory modifications implied by user commands in the context of the planned motion and conversation history. Importantly, our system provides verbal feedback in response to the user, either assuring any resulting changes or posing a clarifying question. We evaluated our method in a user study with 18 older adults across three assistive tasks, comparing BRIDGE to an ablation without verbal feedback and a baseline. Results show that participants successfully used the system to modify trajectories in real time. Moreover, the bidirectional feedback led to significantly higher ratings of interactivity and transparency, demonstrating that the robot's verbal response is critical for a more intuitive user experience.

However, state-of-the-art model-based planners for CRM are still focused on feasibility rather than optimality, limiting their ability to fully exploit CRM's advantages. We introduce a new paradigm that computes approximately optimal manipulator plans. This approach has two phases. Offline, we construct a graph of mutual reachable sets, where each set contains all object orientations reachable from a starting object orientation and grasp. Online, we plan over this graph, effectively computing and sequencing local plans for globally optimized motion. On a challenging, representative contact-rich task, our approach outperforms a leading planner, reducing task cost by 61%. It also achieves a 91% success rate across 250 queries and maintains sub-minute query times, ultimately demonstrating that globally optimized contact-rich manipulation is now practical for real-world tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u8fbe\u96c6\u56fe\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u8be5\u56fe\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\u5668\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08CRM\uff09\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u800c\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528CRM\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e92\u8fbe\u96c6\u5408\u56fe\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u96c6\u5408\u5305\u542b\u4ece\u8d77\u59cb\u7269\u4f53\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u6293\u63e1\u5904\u53ef\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u6240\u6709\u7269\u4f53\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5219\u5728\u6b64\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba1\u5212\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u9886\u5148\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8661%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728250\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8691%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u64cd\u4f5c\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002"}}

However, openness also exacerbates the inherent dual-use risks associated with research and innovation in robotics. It lowers barriers for states and non-state actors to develop and deploy robotics systems for military use and harmful purposes. Compared to other fields of engineering where dual-use risks are present - e.g., those that underlie the development of weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons) and even the field of AI, robotics offers no specific regulation and little guidance as to how research and innovation may be conducted and disseminated responsibly. While other fields can be used for guidance, robotics has its own needs and specificities which have to be taken into account. The robotics community should therefore work toward its own set of sector-specific guidance and possibly regulation. To that end, we propose a roadmap focusing on four practices: a) education in responsible robotics; b) incentivizing risk assessment; c) moderating the diffusion of high-risk material; and d) developing red lines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u653e\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u53cc\u5203\u5251\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5373\u867d\u7136\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u519b\u4e8b\u6216\u6709\u5bb3\u76ee\u7684\u7684\u95e8\u69db\u3002\u9274\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u653e\u83b7\u53d6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8fdb\u5165\u95e8\u69db\u3001\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u53ef\u9760\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u4e5f\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4e24\u7528\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u975e\u56fd\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7528\u4e8e\u519b\u4e8b\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u6709\u5bb3\u76ee\u7684\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u63aa\u65bd\u53ca\u8d23\u4efb\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5f53\u524d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u53c2\u8003\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e24\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6740\u4f24\u6027\u6b66\u5668\u7684\u7814\u53d1\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9886\u57df\uff09\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u7a0b\u6280\u672f\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u6fc0\u52b1\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u8c03\u8282\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6750\u6599\u6269\u6563\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u7ea2\u7ebf\u7b49\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u83b7\u53d6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u53cc\u5203\u5251\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u754c\u9700\u8981\u5236\u5b9a\u4e00\u5957\u4e13\u95e8\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u672c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u751a\u81f3\u6cd5\u89c4\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u53d6\u7684\u63aa\u65bd\u5305\u62ec\u52a0\u5f3a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u9f13\u52b1\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u9002\u5f53\u63a7\u5236\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u4ee5\u53ca\u660e\u786e\u754c\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53ef\u903e\u8d8a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u754c\u9650\u3002"}}

End-to-end visuomotor policies bypass this structure, but often require large amounts of data, transfer poorly from simulation to reality, and generalize weakly across tasks/embodiments. We address those limitations by leveraging a simple insight: dexterous manipulation is inherently hierarchical - at a high level, a robot decides where to touch (geometry) and move the object (kinematics); at a low level it determines how to realize that plan through contact dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose a hierarchical RL--MPC framework in which a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) policy predicts a contact intention, a novel object-centric interface that specifies (i) an object-surface contact location and (ii) a post-contact object-level subgoal pose. Conditioned on this contact intention, a low-level contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) optimizes local contact modes and replans with contact dynamics to generate robot actions that robustly drive the object toward each subgoal.

Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Cranes have long been essential equipment for lifting and placing heavy loads in construction projects. This study focuses on the lowering phase of crane operation, the stage in which the load is moved to the desired location. During this phase, a constant challenge exists: the load obstructs the operator's view of the landing point. As a result, operators traditionally have to rely on verbal or gestural instructions from ground personnel, which significantly impacts site safety. To alleviate this constraint, the proposed system incorporates a attachable camera module designed to be attached directly to the load via a suction cup. This module houses a single-board computer, battery, and compact camera. After installation, it streams and processes images of the ground directly below the load in real time to generate installation guidance. Simultaneously, this guidance is transmitted to and monitored by a host computer. Preliminary experiments were conducted by attaching this module to a test object, confirming the feasibility of real-time image acquisition and transmission. This approach has the potential to significantly improve safety on construction sites by providing crane operators with an instant visual reference of hidden landing zones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9644\u7740\u4e8e\u8d77\u91cd\u673a\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u7684\u6444\u50cf\u6a21\u5757\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u5904\u7406\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u65b9\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8d77\u91cd\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0b\u964d\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u906e\u6321\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u5bf9\u964d\u843d\u70b9\u7684\u89c6\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5730\u9762\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u53e3\u5934\u6216\u624b\u52bf\u6307\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5927\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5de5\u5730\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6539\u5584\u8fd9\u4e00\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u5438\u76d8\u56fa\u5b9a\u5728\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u7684\u6444\u50cf\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u5355\u677f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u3001\u7535\u6c60\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u76f8\u673a\u3002\u5b89\u88c5\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6b63\u4e0b\u65b9\u7684\u5730\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u53d1\u9001\u7ed9\u4e3b\u673a\u7535\u8111\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u63a7\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u6b64\u6a21\u5757\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7269\u4f53\u4e0a\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u5373\u65f6\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u964d\u843d\u533a\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u671b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in instruction parsing and preliminary planning, they exhibit limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination. We propose Hierarchical Autonomous Intelligent Multi-Robot Planning(H-AIM), a novel embodied multi-robot task planning framework that addresses these issues through a three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) It leverages an LLM to parse instructions and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem descriptions, thereby transforming commands into formal planning problems; 2) It combines the semantic reasoning of LLMs with the search capabilities of a classical planner to produce optimized action sequences; 3) It compiles the resulting plan into behavior trees for reactive control. The framework supports dynamically sized heterogeneous robot teams via a shared blackboard mechanism for communication and state synchronization. To validate our approach, we introduce the MACE-THOR benchmark dataset, comprising 42 complex tasks across 8 distinct household layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that H-AIM achieves a remarkable performance improvement, elevating the task success rate from 12% to 55% and boosting the goal condition recall from 32% to 72% against the strongest baseline, LaMMA-P.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aH-AIM\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e2\u961f\u6267\u884c\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u89e3\u6790\u6307\u4ee4\u5e76\u751f\u6210PDDL\u95ee\u9898\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8ba1\u5212\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u6811\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cH-AIM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8ba9\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e2\u961f\u6839\u636e\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u6307\u4ee4\u6267\u884c\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u521d\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u957f\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aH-AIM\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ea7\u8054\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u6790\u6307\u4ee4\u5e76\u751f\u6210PDDL\u95ee\u9898\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b3\uff09\u5c06\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u7f16\u8bd1\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u6811\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u9ed1\u677f\u673a\u5236\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e2\u961f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebfLaMMA-P\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cH-AIM\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece12%\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230\u4e8655%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ece32%\u63d0\u5347\u81f372%\u3002", "conclusion": "H-AIM\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e2\u961f\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u53ca\u76ee\u6807\u8fbe\u6210\u5ea6\u3002"}}

To accomplish this task more effectively, robots need to actively adapt support strategies throughout the long-horizon assembly process, while also generalizing across diverse part geometries. We propose A3D, a framework which learns adaptive affordances to identify optimal support and stabilization locations on furniture parts. The method employs dense point-level geometric representations to model part interaction patterns, enabling generalization across varied geometries. To handle evolving assembly states, we introduce an adaptive module that uses interaction feedback to dynamically adjust support strategies during assembly based on previous interactions. We establish a simulation environment featuring 50 diverse parts across 8 furniture types, designed for dual-arm collaboration evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our framework generalizes effectively to diverse part geometries and furniture categories in both simulation and real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faA3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u5bb6\u5177\u90e8\u4ef6\u4e0a\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u652f\u6301\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u70b9\u7ea7\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u90e8\u4ef6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u53cd\u9988\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u652f\u6301\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u90e8\u4ef6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bb6\u5177\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bb6\u5177\u7ec4\u88c5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u53cc\u81c2\u534f\u8c03\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u624b\u81c2\u64cd\u7eb5\u90e8\u4ef6\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u534f\u4f5c\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u8fd9\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u7ec4\u88c5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u652f\u6301\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u8981\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u5404\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u90e8\u4ef6\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86A3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5bb6\u5177\u90e8\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u652f\u6301\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u70b9\u7ea7\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u5f81\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u90e8\u4ef6\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u4e92\u53cd\u9988\u6839\u636e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7ec4\u88c5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b50\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u4ef6\u3001\u8986\u76d68\u7c7b\u5bb6\u5177\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u90e8\u4ef6\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u5bb6\u5177\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "A3D\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5bb6\u5177\u7ec4\u88c5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u90e8\u4ef6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u652f\u6301\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7ec4\u88c5\u3002"}}

However, their deployment remains complex due to the fragmented interfaces and the inherent communication latency in distributed setups. To address this, we introduce VLAgents, a modular policy server that abstracts VLA inferencing behind a unified Gymnasium-style protocol. Crucially, its communication layer transparently adapts to the context by supporting both zero-copy shared memory for high-speed simulation and compressed streaming for remote hardware. In this work, we present the architecture of VLAgents and validate it by integrating seven policies -- including OpenVLA and Pi Zero. In a benchmark with both local and remote communication, we further demonstrate how it outperforms the default policy servers provided by OpenVLA, OpenPi, and LeRobot.

Existing methods usually improve generalization by scaling data and networks, but model tasks independently and overlook skill-level information. Observing that tasks within the same skill share similar motion patterns, we propose Skill-Aware Diffusion (SADiff), which explicitly incorporates skill-level information to improve generalization. SADiff learns skill-specific representations through a skill-aware encoding module with learnable skill tokens, and conditions a skill-constrained diffusion model to generate object-centric motion flow. A skill-retrieval transformation strategy further exploits skill-specific trajectory priors to refine the mapping from 2D motion flow to executable 3D actions. Furthermore, we introduce IsaacSkill, a high-fidelity dataset containing fundamental robotic skills for comprehensive evaluation and sim-to-real transfer. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that SADiff achieves good performance and generalization across various manipulation tasks.

This distributed safety control filter is developed using control barrier function (CBF) theory and the application is clearly described to ensure explainability of these safety-critical methods. This work compares the worst-case CBF approach with a Collision Regulations (COLREGS) behavior-based approach in simulated encounters. Real-world experiments with three different uncrewed vessels and a human operated vessel were performed to confirm the approach is effective across a range of platforms and is robust to uncooperative behavior from human operators.

Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning. Extensive experiments in real-world and simulation environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves 98.5%, 84.1%, and 47.4% on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus and VLABench, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784ACoT-VLA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5305\u62ec\u663e\u5f0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u5668\uff08EAR\uff09\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u5668\uff08IAR\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7c97\u7565\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u610f\u56fe\u6307\u5bfc\u6700\u7ec8\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728LIBERO\u3001LIBERO-Plus\u548cVLABench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c(VLA)\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u5f80\u5f80\u95f4\u63a5\u4e14\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4f20\u8fbe\u6267\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f62\u5f0f\u5e94\u8be5\u76f4\u63a5\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT)\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aACoT-VLA\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86ACoT\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u663e\u5f0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u5668\uff08EAR\uff09\u8d1f\u8d23\u63d0\u51fa\u7c97\u7565\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b\u9690\u5f0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u5668\uff08IAR\uff09\u5219\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u5171\u540c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2aACoT\u94fe\uff0c\u7528\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u4e0b\u6e38\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LIBERO\u3001LIBERO-Plus\u548cVLABench\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8698.5%\u300184.1%\u4ee5\u53ca47.4%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5373\u5229\u7528ACoT\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, these datasets and their task designs often lack systematic consideration and principles. This raises important questions: Do the current datasets and task designs truly advance the capabilities of robotic agents? Do evaluations on a few common tasks accurately reflect the differentiated performance of various methods proposed by different teams and evaluated on different tasks? To address these issues, we introduce the Great March 100 (\\textbf{GM-100}) as the first step towards a robot learning Olympics. GM-100 consists of 100 carefully designed tasks that cover a wide range of interactions and long-tail behaviors, aiming to provide a diverse and challenging set of tasks to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of robotic agents and promote diversity and complexity in robot dataset task designs. These tasks are developed through systematic analysis and expansion of existing task designs, combined with insights from human-object interaction primitives and object affordances. We collect a large amount of trajectory data on different robotic platforms and evaluate several baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-100 tasks are 1) feasible to execute and 2) sufficiently challenging to effectively differentiate the performance of current VLA models.
