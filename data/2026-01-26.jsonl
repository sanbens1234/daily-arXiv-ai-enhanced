Mattila"], "title": "Scalable Screw-Theoretic Synthesis for PDE-Based Dynamic Modeling of Multibody Flexible Manipulators", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper presents a novel and scalable screw-theoretic multibody synthesis framework for PDE-based dynamic modeling of serial robotic manipulators with an arbitrary number of flexible links in three-dimensional space. The proposed approach systematically constructs screw-theoretic PDE models for individual flexible links and rigorously enforces holonomic joint constraints through interaction forces. The dynamics of each link are formulated using a set of dual screws expressed in body-fixed coordinates: one describing the motion of the body-fixed frame relative to the inertial frame, a second relating the body-fixed frame to the undeformed configuration, and a third capturing elastic deformations. By expressing the system energy and applying variational principles, the governing dynamics of each link had been previously derived in a unified manner. Synthesizing the individual link models yields an infinitely scalable multibody representation capable of capturing both local (subsystem-level) and global (system-level) dynamics. The framework explicitly recovers all dynamic states, including the motion of each body-fixed frame and the distributed deformation fields of the flexible links. For computational tractability and mathematical rigor, the resulting governing equations are formulated as a semi-explicit index-1 differential-algebraic system. Furthermore, by applying separation of variables, the PDE model is recast as an abstract Cauchy problem, and well-posedness of the resulting system is established."}

The system was implemented as an application of the Distributed Multi-Vehicle Architecture (DMAVA) for synchronized multi-host execution. Most existing simulation approaches rely on centralized or non-distributed designs that constrain scalability and limit fully autonomous control. This work introduces two modules built on top of the DMAVA: 1) a Multi-Vehicle AVP Node that performs state-based coordination, queuing, and reservation management across multiple vehicles, and 2) a Unity-Integrated YOLOv5 Parking Spot Detection Module that provides real-time, vision-based perception within AWSIM Labs. Both modules integrate seamlessly with the DMAVA and extend it specifically for multi-vehicle AVP operation, supported by a Zenoh-based communication layer that ensures low-latency topic synchronization and coordinated behavior across hosts. Experiments conducted on two- and three-host configurations demonstrate deterministic coordination, conflict-free parking behavior, and scalable performance across distributed Autoware instances. The results confirm that the proposed Distributed Multi-Vehicle AVP System supports cooperative AVP simulation and establishes a foundation for future real-world and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

To enable high-precision estimation under the low-observability conditions encountered at lunar distances, we develop a stochastic-cloning UD-factorized filter and delayed-state smoother that provide enhanced numerical stability when processing precise time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) measurements. A comprehensive dynamics and measurement model is formulated, explicitly accounting for relativistic coupling between orbital and clock states, lunar time-scale transformations, and signal propagation delays including ionospheric, plasmaspheric, and Shapiro effects. The proposed approach is evaluated using high-fidelity Monte-Carlo simulations incorporating realistic multi-constellation GNSS geometry, broadcast ephemeris errors, lunar satellite dynamics, and ionospheric and plasmaspheric delay computed from empirical electron density models. Simulation results demonstrate that combining ionosphere-free pseudorange and TDCP measurements achieves meter-level orbit accuracy and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity accuracy, satisfying the stringent signal-in-space error requirements of future Lunar Augmented Navigation Services (LANS)."}

This paper proposes an energy-aware CPP framework grounded in Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning, designed for grid-based environments with obstacles and charging stations. To enable robust and adaptive decision-making under energy limitations, the framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal dynamics. A dedicated reward function is designed to jointly optimize coverage efficiency, energy consumption, and return-to-base constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves over 90% coverage while ensuring energy safety, outperforming traditional heuristic algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) baselines by 13.4-19.5% in coverage and reducing constraint violations by 59.9-88.3%. These findings validate the proposed SAC-based framework as an effective and scalable solution for energy-constrained CPP in agricultural robotics."}

However, these typically require individual, specialized experiments with separate models and identification procedures. This article presents a unified approach to the static calibration of industrial robots that identifies a robot model, including geometric and non-geometric effects (compliant bending, thermal deformation, gear transmission errors), using only a single, straightforward experiment for data collection. The model augments the kinematic chain with virtual joints for each modeled effect and realizes the identification using Gauss-Newton optimization with analytic gradients. Fisher information spectra show that the estimation is well-conditioned and the parameterization near-minimal, whereas systematic temporal cross-validation and model ablations demonstrate robustness of the model identification. The resulting model is very accurate and its identification robust, achieving a mean position error of 26.8 $μm$ on a KUKA KR30 industrial robot compared to 102.3 $μm$ for purely geometric calibration."}

However, previous methods fuse proprioceptive signals directly with VLM-encoded vision-language features, resulting in state-dominant bias and false completions despite visible execution failures. We attribute this to modality imbalance, where policies over-rely on internal state while underusing visual evidence. To address this, we present ReViP, a novel VLA framework with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance to enhance visual grounding and robustness under perturbations. The key insight is to introduce auxiliary task-aware environment priors to adaptively modulate the coupling between semantic perception and proprioceptive dynamics. Specifically, we use an external VLM as a task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues from visual observations, which drive a Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation to enhance environmental awareness and reduce state-driven errors. Moreover, to evaluate false completion, we propose the first False-Completion Benchmark Suite built on LIBERO with controlled settings such as Object-Drop. Extensive experiments show that ReViP effectively reduces false-completion rates and improves success rates over strong VLA baselines on our suite, with gains extending to LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world evaluations."}

Virtual environments offer a cost-effective alternative for training DRL agents, but the transfer of learned policies to real setups is hindered by the sim-to-real gap. Achieving zero-shot transfer, where agents perform directly in real environments without additional tuning, is particularly desirable for its efficiency and practical value. This work proposes a novel domain adaptation approach relying on a Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (StyleID-CycleGAN or SICGAN), an original Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model. SICGAN translates raw virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating a hybrid domain for training DRL agents that combines virtual dynamics with real-like visual inputs. Following virtual training, the agent can be directly deployed, bypassing the need for real-world training. The pipeline is validated with two distinct industrial robots in the approaching phase of a pick-and-place operation. In virtual environments agents achieve success rates of 90 to 100\\%, and real-world deployment confirms robust zero-shot transfer (i.e., without additional training in the physical environment) with accuracies above 95\\% for most workspace regions. We use augmented reality targets to improve the evaluation process efficiency, and experimentally demonstrate that the agent successfully generalizes to real objects of varying colors and shapes, including LEGO\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}~cubes and a mug.

We introduce Adaptive Reinforcement and Model Predictive Control Switching (ARMS), a hybrid learning-control framework that integrates a reinforcement learning follower trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and an analytical one-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulated as a quadratic program safety filter. To enable robust perception under partial observability and non-stationary human motion, ARMS employs a decoupled sensing architecture with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) temporal encoder for the human-robot relative state and a spatial encoder for 360-degree LiDAR scans. The core contribution is a learned adaptive neural switcher that performs context-aware soft action fusion between the two controllers, favoring conservative, constraint-aware QP-based control in low-risk regions while progressively shifting control authority to the learned follower in highly cluttered or constrained scenarios where maneuverability is critical, and reverting to the follower action when the QP becomes infeasible. Extensive evaluations against Pure Pursuit, Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), and an RL-only baseline demonstrate that ARMS achieves an 82.5 percent success rate in highly cluttered environments, outperforming DWA and RL-only approaches by 7.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, while reducing average computational latency by 33 percent to 5.2 milliseconds compared to a multi-step MPC baseline. Additional simulation transfer in Gazebo and initial real-world deployment results further indicate the practicality and robustness of ARMS for safe and efficient human-robot collaboration.

They often dynamically crouch their legs during prey sensing, likely an active sensing strategy. However, how leg crouching enhances sensing is poorly understood, because measuring system vibrations in behaving animals is difficult. We use robophysical modeling to study this problem. Our previous spider robot had only four legs, simplified leg morphology, and a shallow crouching range of motion. Here, we developed a new spider robot, with eight legs, each with four joints that better approximated spider leg morphology. Leg exoskeletons were 3-D printed and joint stiffness was tuned using integrated silicone molding with variable materials and geometry. Tendon-driven actuation allowed a motor in the body to crouch all eight legs deeply as spiders do, while accelerometers at leg joints record leg vibrations. Experiments showed that our new spider robot reproduced key vibration features observed in the previous robot while improving biological accuracy. Our new robot provides a biologically more accurate robophysical model for studying how leg behaviors modulate vibration sensing on a web."}

However, to deliver such assistance, accurate prediction of the user's joint torques is essential. In this work, we propose a feature extraction pipeline using 8-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to predict elbow and shoulder joint torques. For preliminary evaluation, this pipeline was integrated into two neural network models: the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Data were collected from a single subject performing elbow and shoulder movements under three load conditions (0 kg, 1.10 kg, and 1.85 kg) using three motion-capture cameras. Reference torques were estimated from center-of-mass kinematics under the assumption of static equilibrium. Our offline analyses showed that, with our feature extraction pipeline, MLP model achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m, 1.403 N m, and 1.434 N m (over five seeds) for elbow, front-shoulder, and side-shoulder joints, respectively, which were comparable to the TCN performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to that of a network designed explicitly for temporal dependencies.

To address this gap, we propose a multimodal data collection framework that employs a dialogue-based interaction protocol and a two-room Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) setup to simulate robot autonomy while eliciting natural user behavior. The framework records five synchronized modalities: RGB-D video, conversational audio, inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals, end-effector Cartesian pose, and whole-body joint states across five assistive tasks. Using this framework, we collected a pilot dataset of 53 trials from five participants and validated its quality through motion smoothness analysis and user feedback. The results show that the framework effectively captures diverse ambiguity types and supports natural dialogue-driven interaction, demonstrating its suitability for scaling to a larger dataset for learning, benchmarking, and evaluation of ambiguity-aware assistive control."}
