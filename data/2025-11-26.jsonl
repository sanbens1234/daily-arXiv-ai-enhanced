Most current data is obtained via human teleoperation, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn useful skills through autonomous exploration, making them a viable approach for generating data. However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space. When adapted to unseen downstream task suites, VLA models pretrained on our diverse RL data surpass counterparts trained on equal-sized standard RL datasets. Moreover, DLR exhibits positive data-scaling behavior that single-pattern RL lacks. These results position multi-pattern RL as a practical, scalable data engine for embodied foundation models."}

Additionally, we propose the use of augmented reality to facilitate bidirectional communication between humans and robots during handovers. We assess the performance of our controller in a set of experiments that demonstrate its resilience to various sources of uncertainties, including complex changes to the object's pose during the handover.

The messy, real-world data encountered during deployment (e.g. occluded or multilingual text) remains massively underrepresented in existing corpora. Robots, as embodied agents, are uniquely positioned to close this gap: they can act in physical environments to collect large-scale, real-world data that enriches FM training with precisely the examples current models lack. We introduce the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, a framework that transforms robots from FM consumers into data generators. By deploying robots equipped with FMs in the wild, we enable a virtuous cycle: robots perform useful tasks while collecting real-world data that improves both domain-specific adaptation and domain-adjacent generalization. We instantiate this framework with Scanford, a mobile manipulator deployed in the East Asia Library for 2 weeks. Scanford autonomously scans shelves, identifies books using a vision-language model (VLM), and leverages the library catalog to label images without human annotation. This deployment both aids librarians and produces a dataset to finetune the underlying VLM, improving performance on the domain-specific in-the-wild library setting and on domain-adjacent multilingual OCR benchmarks. Using data collected from 2103 shelves, Scanford improves VLM performance on book identification from 32.0% to 71.8% and boosts domain-adjacent multilingual OCR from 24.8% to 46.6% (English) and 30.8% to 38.0% (Chinese), while saving an ~18.7 hrs of human time. These results highlight how robot-powered data flywheels can both reduce human effort in real deployments and unlock new pathways for continually adapting FMs to the messiness of reality.

In our work, we focus on autonomous vehicles in road and perform experiments to analyze the effect of low-level controllers in the simulation and a real environment. To increase the precision and stability of trajectory tracking in autonomous cars, a novel method that combines lane identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC) is presented. The research focuses on camera-equipped autonomous vehicles and uses methods like edge recognition, sliding window-based straight-line identification for lane line extraction, and dynamic region of interest (ROI) extraction. Next, to follow the identified lane line, an MPC built on a bicycle vehicle dynamics model is created. A single-lane road simulation model is built using ROS Gazebo and tested in order to verify the controller's performance. The root mean square error between the optimal tracking trajectory and the target trajectory was reduced by 27.65% in the simulation results, demonstrating the high robustness and flexibility of the developed controller."}

Existing methods face a trad-off: online planners and controllers lack formal safety guarantees, while offline planners lack adaptability to changes in the number of agents or desired formation. To address this gap, we propose a hybrid architecture where a single leader tracks a pre-computed, safe trajectory, which serves as a shared trajectory backup set for all follower agents. Followers execute a nominal formation-keeping tracking controller, and are guaranteed to remain safe by always possessing a known-safe backup maneuver along the leader's path. We formally prove this method ensures collision avoidance with both static obstacles and other agents. The primary contributions are: (1) the multi-agent gatekeeper algorithm, which extends our single-agent gatekeeper framework to multi-agent systems; (2) the trajectory backup set for provably safe inter-agent coordination for leader-follower formation control; and (3) the first application of the gatekeeper framework in a 3D environment. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated 3D urban environment, where it achieved a 100% collision-avoidance success rate across 100 randomized trials, significantly outperforming baseline CBF and NMPC methods.

Nevertheless, these strategies face two inherent challenges: (i) a modality gap between visual observations and low-level actions, and (ii) unstable training due to competing objectives between visual prediction and action generation. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision-Integrated Trajectory Alignment (VITA) framework that learns a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling joint modeling of perception and motor control. VITA introduces a implicit visual CoT: autoregressively generated tokens is simultaneously decoded into future frames predictions and robot actions, thereby internalizing visual dynamics as an inductive bias for motion planning. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world environments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. VITA improves 14.5\\%, 9.6\\% and 12.1\\% over existing baselines on CALVIN, LIBERO and SimplerEnv.

Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns. Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios. However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA. The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator. Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic. The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets. The discriminator is trained adversarially to facilitate the transfer of long-tail handling capabilities from simulated to real-world environments by the student VLM model, using a novel backpropagation strategy."}

Existing approaches typically model it as a discrete and static process, while real-world applications involve continuous gravity-driven interactions. This idealized simplification leads to infeasible deployments (e.g., unstable packing) in practice. Simulations with physical engine offer an opportunity to emulate continuous gravity effects, enabling the training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to address such limitations and improve packing stability. However, a simulation-to-reality gap persists due to dynamic variations in physical properties of real-world objects, such as various friction coefficients, elasticity, and non-uniform weight distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid RL framework that collaborates with physical simulation with real-world data feedback. Firstly, domain randomization is applied during simulation to expose agents to a spectrum of physical parameters, enhancing their generalization capability. Secondly, the RL agent is fine-tuned with real-world deployment feedback, further reducing collapse rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves lower collapse rates in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Large-scale deployments in logistics systems validate the practical effectiveness, with a 35\\% reduction in packing collapse compared to baseline methods."}

To offer a more cost-efficient and easy-accessible source of contact feedback, we present ShapeForce, a low-cost, plug-and-play soft wrist that provides force-like signals for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Inspired by how humans rely on relative force changes in contact rather than precise force magnitudes, ShapeForce converts external force and torque into measurable deformations of its compliant core, which are then estimated via marker-based pose tracking and converted into force-like signals. Our design eliminates the need for calibration or specialized electronics to obtain exact values, and instead focuses on capturing force and torque changes sufficient for enabling contact-rich manipulation. Extensive experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks and manipulation policies demonstrate that ShapeForce delivers performance comparable to six-axis force-torque sensors at an extremely low cost."}

A generic control framework is therefore essential, and a key obstacle lies in the persistent use of rigid-body control logic, which relies on precise models and strict low-level execution. Such a paradigm is effective for rigid robots but fails for soft robots, where the ability to tolerate and exploit approximate action representations, i.e., control compliance, is the basis of robustness and adaptability rather than a disturbance to be eliminated. Control should thus shift from suppressing compliance to explicitly exploiting it. Human motor control exemplifies this principle: instead of computing exact dynamics or issuing detailed muscle-level commands, it expresses intention through high-level movement tendencies, while reflexes and biomechanical mechanisms autonomously resolve local details. This architecture enables robustness, flexibility, and cross-task generalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose a generic soft-robot control framework grounded in control compliance and validate it across robots with diverse morphologies and actuation mechanisms. The results demonstrate stable, safe, and cross-platform transferable behavior, indicating that embracing control compliance, rather than resisting it, may provide a widely applicable foundation for unified soft-robot control."}

Simultaneously, we explicitly model the external pulling disturbances through a spring-damper system and achieve fine-grained force control by manipulating the virtual spring.

This study explores human-robot interactions during handover tasks using Virtual Reality (VR) to investigate differences in human motor performance across various task dynamics and robot kinematics. A VR-based robot handover simulation afforded safe and controlled assessments of human-robot interactions. In separate experiments, four potential influences on human performance were examined (1) control over task initiation and robot movement synchrony (temporal and spatiotemporal); (2) partner appearance (human versus robotic); (3) robot velocity profiles (minimum jerk, constant velocity, constant acceleration, and biphasic); and (4) the timing of rotational object motion. Findings across experiments emphasize humans benefit from robots providing early and salient visual information about task-relevant object motion, and advantages of human-like smooth robot trajectories. To varying degrees, these manipulations improved predictive accuracy and synchronization during interaction. This suggests that human-robot interactions should be designed to allow humans to leverage their natural capabilities for detecting biological motion, which conversely may reduce the need for costly robotic computations or added cognitive adaptation on the human side."}

In particular, our approach introduces new and efficient methods for view generation and selection of viewpoint candidates that are adaptive to the user-defined quality requirements, fully exploiting the uncertainty encoded in a Truncated Signed Distance field (TSDF) representation of the environment. This results in informed and efficient exploration decisions tailored towards the predetermined objective. Finally, we validate our method via extensive simulations in realistic environments. We demonstrate that it successfully adjusts its behavior to the user goal while consistently outperforming conventional NBV strategies in terms of coverage, quality of the final 3D map and path efficiency."}

However, real-time adaptability in dynamic environments remains a critical challenge for autonomous navigation, particularly when robots must generate collision-free, smooth, and efficient trajectories under complex constraints. By analyzing the difficulties in dynamic path planning, the Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) algorithm emerges as a promising framework owing to its physically interpretable search dynamics. Motivated by these observations, this work revisits the WDO principle and proposes a variant formulation, Multi-hierarchical adaptive wind driven optimization(MAWDO), that improves adaptability and robustness in time-varying environments. To mitigate instability and premature convergence, a hierarchical-guidance mechanism divides the population into multiple groups guided by individual, regional, and global leaders to balance exploration and exploitation. Extensive evaluations on sixteen benchmark functions show that MAWDO achieves superior optimization accuracy, convergence stability, and adaptability over state-of-the art metaheuristics. In dynamic path planning, MAWDO shortens the path length to 469.28 pixels, improving over Multi-strategy ensemble wind driven optimization(MEWDO), Adaptive wind driven optimization(AWDO) and WDO by 3.51\\%, 11.63\\% and 14.93\\%, and achieves the smallest optimality gap (1.01) with smoothness 0.71 versus 13.50 and 15.67 for AWDO and WDO, leading to smoother, shorter, and collision-free trajectories that confirm its effectiveness for real-time path planning in complex environments."}
