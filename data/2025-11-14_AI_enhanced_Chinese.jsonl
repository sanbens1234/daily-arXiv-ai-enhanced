However, the realization of the generated motion plans is often compromised by a ''task-execution mismatch'', where unmodeled dynamics, persistent disturbances, and system latency cause the robot's actual task-space state to diverge from the desired motion trajectory. We propose a novel task-level robust control architecture, L1-augmented Dynamical Systems (L1-DS), that explicitly handles the task-execution mismatch in tracking a nominal motion plan generated by any DS-based LfD scheme. Our framework augments any DS-based LfD model with a nominal stabilizing controller and an L1 adaptive controller. Furthermore, we introduce a windowed Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based target selector, which enables the nominal stabilizing controller to handle temporal misalignment for improved phase-consistent tracking. We demonstrate the efficacy of our architecture on the LASA and IROS handwriting datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784L1-\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08L1-DS\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u540d\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548cL1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6765\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u6559\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u4e8e\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bfc\u81f4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u6559\u65b9\u6848\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u671f\u671b\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aL1-\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u4efb\u4f55\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u6559\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u540d\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548cL1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a97\u53e3\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u6574\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7LASA\u548cIROS\u624b\u5199\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "L1-\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6309\u7167\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u6559\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Paper Website: (https://usahai18.github.io/stein_clarity/)", "summary": "Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed for information-gathering tasks in environments that vary across space and time. Planning informative and safe trajectories in such settings is challenging because information decays when regions are not revisited. Most existing planners model information as static or uniformly decaying, ignoring environments where the decay rate varies spatially; those that model non-uniform decay often overlook how it evolves along the robot's motion, and almost all treat safety as a soft penalty. In this paper, we address these challenges. We model uncertainty in the environment using clarity, a normalized representation of differential entropy from our earlier work that captures how information improves through new measurements and decays over time when regions are not revisited. Building on this, we present Stein Variational Clarity-Aware Informative Planning, a framework that embeds clarity dynamics within trajectory optimization and enforces safety through a low-level filtering mechanism based on our earlier gatekeeper framework for safety verification. The planner performs Bayesian inference-based learning via Stein variational inference, refining a distribution over informative trajectories while filtering each nominal Stein informative trajectory to ensure safety. Hardware experiments and simulations across environments with varying decay rates and obstacles demonstrate consistent safety and reduced information deficits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c4\u5212\u65e2\u5b89\u5168\u53c8\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u8868\u793a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Stein\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u8981\u4e48\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u6216\u5747\u5300\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u968f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u800c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u90fd\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u53d8\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89c4\u5212\u51fa\u65e2\u5b89\u5168\u53c8\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "1. \u91c7\u7528'\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6'\u8fd9\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5dee\u71b5\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6355\u6349\u4fe1\u606f\u968f\u65b0\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u6539\u5584\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u88ab\u518d\u6b21\u8bbf\u95ee\u533a\u57df\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u8870\u9000\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\n2. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Stein\u53d8\u5206\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u95e8\u536b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\n3. \u5229\u7528Stein\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f18\u5316\u5177\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6389\u6bcf\u4e2a\u540d\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684Stein\u4fe1\u606f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u548c\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u4fe1\u606f\u8870\u51cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Some methods can collect large amounts of trajectory augmentation data to train more generalizable imitation learning policies, aimed at handling the random placement of objects on the scene's horizontal plane. However, the data generated by these methods still lack diversity, which limits the generalization ability of the trained policy. To address this, we investigate the performance of policies trained by existing methods across different scene layout factors via automate the data generation for those factors that significantly impact generalization. We have created a more extensively randomized dataset that can be efficiently and automatically generated with only a small amount of human demonstration. The dataset covers five types of manipulators and two types of grippers, incorporating extensive randomization factors such as camera pose, lighting conditions, tabletop texture, and table height across six manipulation tasks. We found that all of these factors influence the generalization ability of the policy. Applying any form of randomization enhances policy generalization, with diverse trajectories particularly effective in bridging visual gap.

However, vision-only VLA models create fundamental limitations, particularly in perceiving interactive and manipulation dynamic processes. This paper proposes Audio-VLA, a multimodal manipulation policy that leverages contact audio to perceive contact events and dynamic process feedback. Audio-VLA overcomes the vision-only constraints of VLA models. Additionally, this paper introduces the Task Completion Rate (TCR) metric to systematically evaluate dynamic operational processes. Audio-VLA employs pre-trained DINOv2 and SigLIP as visual encoders, AudioCLIP as the audio encoder, and Llama2 as the large language model backbone. We apply LoRA fine-tuning to these pre-trained modules to achieve robust cross-modal understanding of both visual and acoustic inputs. A multimodal projection layer aligns features from different modalities into the same feature space. Moreover RLBench and LIBERO simulation environments are enhanced by adding collision-based audio generation to provide realistic sound feedback during object interactions. Since current robotic manipulation evaluations focus on final outcomes rather than providing systematic assessment of dynamic operational processes, the proposed TCR metric measures how well robots perceive dynamic processes during manipulation, creating a more comprehensive evaluation metric. Extensive experiments on LIBERO, RLBench, and two real-world tasks demonstrate Audio-VLA's superior performance over vision-only comparative methods, while the TCR metric effectively quantifies dynamic process perception capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565Audio-VLA\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u58f0\u97f3\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6539\u5584\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\uff08TCR\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b(Vision-Language-Action, VLA)\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u4e92\u52a8\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Audio-VLA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u63a5\u89e6\u97f3\u9891\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u63a5\u89e6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "Audio-VLA\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684DINOv2\u548cSigLIP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001AudioCLIP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u97f3\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u53caLlama2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u8c03\u6574\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6295\u5f71\u5c42\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u540c\u4e00\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u4e5f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86RLBench\u4e0eLIBERO\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u671f\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u542c\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728LIBERO\u3001RLBench\u5e73\u53f0\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u9879\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cAudio-VLA\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TCR\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Audio-VLA\u6a21\u578b\u53caTCR\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored.\n  To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel ``Real-Sim-Real'' framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance. Our findings expose an urgent need for standardized robustness benchmarks and mitigation strategies to secure VLA deployments in safety-critical environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684'\u771f\u5b9e-\u6a21\u62df-\u771f\u5b9e'\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u611f\u5b98\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u800cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684'\u771f\u5b9e-\u6a21\u62df-\u771f\u5b9e'\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u9488\u5bf9\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u7b49\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8VLA\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u5bf9\u8d85\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u7269\u7406\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u8d8a\u4e0d\u540cVLA\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\uff0cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fddVLA\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Link to project website: https://www.robot-learning.uk/learning-1000-tasks", "summary": "Humans are remarkably efficient at learning tasks from demonstrations, but today's imitation learning methods for robot manipulation often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations per task. We investigate two fundamental priors for improving learning efficiency: decomposing manipulation trajectories into sequential alignment and interaction phases, and retrieval-based generalisation. Through 3,450 real-world rollouts, we systematically study this decomposition. We compare different design choices for the alignment and interaction phases, and examine generalisation and scaling trends relative to today's dominant paradigm of behavioural cloning with a single-phase monolithic policy. In the few-demonstrations-per-task regime (<10 demonstrations), decomposition achieves an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency over single-phase learning, with retrieval consistently outperforming behavioural cloning for both alignment and interaction. Building on these insights, we develop Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer (MT3), an imitation learning method based on decomposition and retrieval. MT3 learns everyday manipulation tasks from as little as a single demonstration each, whilst also generalising to novel object instances. This efficiency enables us to teach a robot 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstrator time. Through 2,200 additional real-world rollouts, we reveal MT3's capabilities and limitations across different task families.

Although robotic solutions have the potential to improve operational safety and effectiveness, current systems still lack reliable autonomy and fault management capabilities. To address this gap, we propose a control framework for dependable robotized bolting tasks and instantiate it on a specific robotic system. The system features a control architecture ensuring accurate driving torque control and active compliance throughout the entire operation, enabling safe interaction even under fault conditions. By designing a multimodal human-robot interface (HRI) providing real-time visualization of relevant system information and supporting seamless transitions between automatic and manual control, we improve operator situation awareness and fault detection capabilities. A high-level supervisor (SV) coordinates the execution and manages transitions between control modes, ensuring consistency with the supervisory control (SVC) paradigm, while preserving the human operator's authority. The system is validated in a representative bolting operation involving pipe flange joining, under several fault conditions. The results demonstrate improved fault detection capabilities, enhanced operator situational awareness, and accurate and compliant execution of the bolting operation.

These properties make origami increasingly valuable in robotic and deployable systems. However, accurately simulating their folding behavior and interactions with the environment remains challenging. To address this, we present a design framework for origami mechanism simulation that utilizes MuJoCo's deformable-body capabilities. In our approach, origami sheets are represented as graphs of interconnected deformable elements with user-specified constraints such as creases and actuation, defined through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). This framework allows users to generate physically consistent simulations that capture both the geometric structure of origami mechanisms and their interactions with external objects and surfaces. We demonstrate our method's utility through a case study on an origami catapult, where design parameters are optimized in simulation using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and validated experimentally on physical prototypes. The optimized structure achieves improved throwing performance, illustrating how our system enables rapid, simulation-driven origami design, optimization, and analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528MuJoCo\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u6298\u7eb8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5f62\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u5b9a\u4e49\u6298\u75d5\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u7b49\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6298\u7eb8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6298\u7eb8\u6295\u77f3\u673a\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528CMA-ES\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u539f\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6298\u7eb8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u53ca\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u5230\u6298\u7eb8\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u673a\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5e73\u9762\u677f\u6750\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u4e09\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u548c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u5176\u6298\u53e0\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528MuJoCo\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u4f53\u529f\u80fd\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u6298\u7eb8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6298\u7eb8\u88ab\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7531\u76f8\u4e92\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5143\u7d20\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\uff08GUI\uff09\u5b9a\u4e49\u5982\u6298\u75d5\u548c\u81f4\u52a8\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6298\u7eb8\u6295\u77f3\u673a\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u9002\u5e94\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08CMA-ES\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7269\u7406\u539f\u578b\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8fbe\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6295\u63b7\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u6298\u7eb8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u6298\u7eb8\u673a\u68b0\u88c5\u7f6e\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

To accomplish this, we propose an optimization-based approach to plan a path for the UAV at optimal height where the sensors of the UAV can cover the most area and collect data with minimum uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u707e\u533a\u7684\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6700\u4f73\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8986\u76d6\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u707e\u540e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u73af\u5883\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e3a\u6551\u63f4\u8f66\u8f86\u94fa\u8bbe\u8def\u5f84\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u98de\u884c\u5668\uff08UAV\uff09\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u4fa6\u5bdf\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89c4\u5212UAV\u7684\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u80fd\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u9ad8\u5ea6\u98de\u884c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8986\u76d6\u9762\u79ef\u53ca\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8ba9UAV\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u5730\u9762\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528UAV\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u707e\u540e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u6551\u63f4\u884c\u52a8\u3002"}}
